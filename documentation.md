## Usage
GatorSVG is an ideal tool for creating and managing social media infographics. Here are some typical usage scenarios where GatorSVG can streamline your workflow:

- **Creating Reusable Templates:**
    - **Scenario:** You need to create a series of infographics for social media posts.
    - **Solution:** Design a template in Inkscape with placeholders for images, text, and other elements.
    - **Benefit:** Once the template is set up, you can quickly make minor edits for each new post, such as updating the text, changing the background color, or swapping out images, without having to start from scratch.
- **Updating Event Announcements, Product Promotions, Seasonal Campaigns, Educational Content and so much more.**

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

GatorSVG is available on GitHub. You can clone the repository using Git and install it locally. Here's how:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Use the `git clone` command followed by the GatorSVG repository URL. 
For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/indiemount/GatorSVG.git
```

### Creating and Preparing SVGs

1. **Create SVG Template**
   - Design your graphic directly in Inkscape for optimal compatibility
   - Alternatively, use any vector graphics editor (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, CorelDRAW, Figma, Sketch, Canva)

2. **Save as Inkscape SVG**
   - If using a different app, open your SVG in Inkscape
   - Save the file in **Inkscape SVG format (.svg)**

3. **Start GatorSVG**
   - Launch the GatorSVG application from python IDE or run main.py
   - In GatorSVG, use the file menu to open your Inkscape-saved SVG

By following these steps, you'll have GatorSVG installed and ready to use with your compatible SVG files. This process ensures smooth importing and editing of SVG templates within the application.

## Quick Edits
### Introduction
The Quick Edits feature in GatorSVG allows you to save Quick Edit files, preserving your adjustments for future use. With reusable SVG templates, you can redo the SVG and save it as a new design, enhancing efficiency and consistency in your workflow. This functionality enables users to effortlessly add, remove, or modify elements within their templates and fine-tune attributes and properties.

### Adding New Elements
To access Quick Edits, navigate to the Window menu and select Quick Edits. Click on the "Add" button in the Quick Edits navigation bar to add a new element. This will create a new row where you can specify the details of the element you want to modify.

### ID, Attribute, Type, and Value
- **ID:** The unique identifier of the SVG element you want to edit. You can find this ID in the left-hand property panel in GatorSVG.
  - **Example:** For a text element displayed as `tspan(desc)3`, the ID is `desc`. The ID is always shown in the left-hand property panel under brackets.
- **Attribute:** The specific attribute of the property you want to change. This could be a style attribute like `fill`, a structural attribute like `width`, or an element-specific attribute like `tspan`.
  - **Example:** To change the fill, it will be shown as `(style)fill`, where the attribute is `fill`.
  - Another example is changing the text, shown as `(element){svg}tspan`. Here, the attribute is `{svg}tspan`, and anything inside the brackets indicates the type.
- **Type:** Indicates the category of the attribute. The three types are `Style`, `Normal`, and `Element`.
  - **Example:** For the text content, the type can be found in the attribute label inside the brackets, such as `(element)`.
- **Value:** The new value you want to set for the specified attribute.
  - **Example:** Changing the text content might involve setting the value to "Quick Edit API".

**Get, Set, Delete:**
- **Get:** Use this function to retrieve the current value of an element’s attribute.
- **Set:** Use this function to apply the new value to the element’s attribute.
- **Delete:** Remove the specific attribute modification if it's no longer needed.

### Example
Let's go through an example using the file located at [root]/assets/Sample.svg to cover all the above points:

To change the colour of the description text:
1. **ID:** `desc` (displayed as `tspan(desc)3` in the left-hand property panel, with `desc` under brackets).
2. **Attribute:** `fill` (shown as `(style)fill`, where the attribute is `fill`).
3. **Type:** `Style` (indicated inside the brackets as `style`).
4. **Value:** `#FF5733` (the new color value you want to set).

Steps in Quick Edits:
1. Click "Add" in the Quick Edits navigation bar.
2. Enter `descriptionText` for ID.
3. Enter `fill` for the attribute.
4. Select `Style` for the type.
5. Enter `#FF5733` for the value.

### Saving Quick Edits
After making your changes, you can save the Quick Edits file for future use. This allows you to maintain consistency across similar designs and streamline your workflow. To save your Quick Edits:
- Click the "Save" button.
- Name your Quick Edits file and choose a location to save it.

### Loading Quick Edits
You can load a previously saved Quick Edits file to quickly apply the same set of modifications. This feature is particularly useful for repetitive tasks. To load a Quick Edits file:
- Click the "Load" button.
- Select the Quick Edits file you previously saved.
- All the saved modifications will be applied instantly.

## API Reference

The SVGator API module provides a powerful interface for programmatically manipulating SVG files within the SVGator application. With the API module, users can automate tasks, make rapid adjustments, and integrate SVGator's functionality seamlessly into their workflows.

### Importing the Module

```python
from api import module
```

### Setting Up Parameters

Define the necessary parameters for modifying the SVG file:

* `svg_path`: The file path to the SVG file you want to edit.
* `quick_edit_attrs`: A list of dictionaries containing the attributes to be modified. Each dictionary should include the following keys:
   * `ID`: The ID of the SVG element to be modified.
   * `attribute`: The attribute of the SVG element to be modified.
   * `type`: The type of attribute modification (e.g., 'Style' or 'Normal').
   * `value`: The new value for the attribute.
* `save_option`: The save option for the edited SVG file ('save' or 'save_as').
* `save_as_name`: The file path to save the edited SVG file if `save_option` is set to 'save_as'.

### Calling the `set_element` Function

```python
module.set_element(svg_path, quick_edit_attrs, save_option, save_as_name)
```

This function applies the specified attribute modifications to the SVG file and saves the changes according to the specified save option.

### Example Usage

* **Open the SVG in GatorSVG:**
  * Load your SVG file in GatorSVG.
* **Identify Elements and Attributes:**
  * Select elements in the left panel.
  * Note the attributes displayed in the property panel (ID, attribute, type, value).
* **Update Python Script:**
  * Use the identified attributes to populate the `quick_edit_attrs` list in your script.
* **Reuse the Script:**
  * Modify the `quick_edit_attrs` list as needed.
* **Sample Python Code**

```python
# Import
from api import module

# Define parameters
svg_path = r"Z:\Auto\GatorSVG\assets\Sample.svg"
quick_edit_attrs = [
    {
        'ID': 'desc',
        'attribute': 'fill',
        'type': 'Style',
        'value': '#462254'
    },
    {
        'ID': 'path271',
        'attribute': 'rx',
        'type': 'Normal',
        'value': '15'
    },
    {
        'ID': 'tspan273',
        'attribute': 'tspan',
        'type': 'Element',
        'value': '8.1'
    },
]
save_option = "save_as"
save_as_name = r"Z:\Auto\GatorSVG\test\test_svg_file.svg"

# Call the set_element function
module.set_element(svg_path, quick_edit_attrs, save_option, save_as_name)
```

### Notes:

- Ensure that you have proper permissions to access and modify the SVG file specified in `svg_path`.
- Verify that the attribute modifications provided in `quick_edit_attrs` are valid and compatible with the SVG file.
- Choose the appropriate save option (`save` or `save_as`) based on your requirements for saving the edited SVG file.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the SVGator API module to automate SVG editing tasks and enhance your workflow with SVGator's powerful features.

## Limitations

- **No Animation Support:**
    - GatorSVG is designed for editing static SVGs and does not support SVG animations.
- **Dependency on Inkscape:**
    - Requires Inkscape 1.3 or above for creating and saving compatible SVG files.
    - SVGs created in applications other than Inkscape may experience compatibility issues. Text elements and certain other components might not function as expected in GatorSVG when imported from these external sources.
- **Image Path Dependency:**
    - Imported images must remain in their original paths as Inkscape stores image paths.
    - Moving or deleting original images can break links in the SVG file.
- **Manual Attribute Identification:**
    - Users need to manually identify and document element IDs and attributes for use with the API.
    - This process can be time-consuming and requires attention to detail.
- **Limited to SVG File Format:**
    - While exporting as PNG is supported, GatorSVG primarily focuses on the SVG format.
    - Users looking for extensive file format support may find this limiting.
- **Basic Editing Capabilities:**
    - Quick Edits and API functionalities are focused on basic attribute modifications.
    - Complex graphic editing may still require advanced graphic design software.

By understanding these usage scenarios and limitations, users can effectively leverage GatorSVG for their SVG editing needs while being aware of the tool's constraints.
